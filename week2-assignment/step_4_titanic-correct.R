# After the previous question, you should have transformed the `titanic`
# data to look like this:
#
##   Survived Pclass   Age     Sex      agecat
##          0      3    22    male    15 to 50
##          1      1    38  female    15 to 50
##          1      3    26  female    15 to 50
##          1      1    35  female    15 to 50
##          0      3    35    male    15 to 50
##          0      1    54    male     Over 50
#
# Use a `dplyr` or `tidyr` function or functions to change the `titanic` dataset so that the 
# first six lines look like this, where you've added, for each combination of 
# `Pclass`, `agecat`, and `Sex`, the columns `N` (total number of passengers 
# in that group), `survivors` (the number of people in the group who survived),
# and `perc_survived` (the percent of people in the group who survived).
